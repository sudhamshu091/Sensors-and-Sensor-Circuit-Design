1.Question 1
Which of the following is not a type of sensor in your smart phone?
Ans:Pressure
2.Question 2
What advantage does a thermocouple have over the NTC thermistor? (select all that apply)
Ans:It can measure lower temperatures than NTC temperature
    It can measure higher temperatures than NTC temperature
3.Question 3
Which of the following is true about an NTC thermistor?
Ans:It has excellent accuracy of 0.1%-0.2%
4.Question 4
What is the Steinhart Hart Equation?
Ans:A highly nonlinear equation that models the behavior of thermistors
5.Question 5
Which fact is not true about RTD’s?
Ans:They have a temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of 3.85 Ω/Ω/°C
6.Question 6
Suppose we include the lead resistance in the calculation of temperature for an RTD. If R 3 = 5000 ohms, R a = 50 ohms, V 0 = 3 volts, and V = 6.5 volts, what is R? (Type in a one-decimal number.)
Ans:150 ohm
7.Question 7
What happens if you don’t perform cold junction compensation in a thermocouple circuit?
Ans:7.Question 7
What happens if you don’t perform cold junction compensation in a thermocouple circuit?
Ans:The temperature reading will be inaccurate because you have no way to compensate the circuit for thermoelectric voltages created at the junctions of dissimilar metals.
8.Question 8
Which is the most common thermocouple in use?
Ans:Type K
9.Question 9
In what temperature measurement applications are thermocouples used? (select all that apply)
Ans:Where a large number of measurement points are needed, and you need to keep the total cost of the sensors down
    Measuring temperatures above 1400°C
    When accuracy of worse than 1% is acceptable
    When it is acceptable to do periodic calibration checks
10.Question 10
You are using a 2252Ω thermistor, β = 3940, and you measure a resistance of 672.5 ohms. What is the temperature in °C that you are measuring?
(Type in a one-decimal number)
Ans:55.2
